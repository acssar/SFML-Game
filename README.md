## Project-X (WiP)
This is temporary name of our C++ game   
we are using:
* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) as core multimedia library ![alt_text](http://www.sfml-dev.org/images/sfml-icon.png)
* CMake as a build tool
* Git actions for CI/CD
* Git Projects and issues for management
* Catch2 as test framework
* Doxygen + Sphinx with breathe for generated documentation


There is pretty good structured game engine, and little basics of game, you can try it by downloading out latest release.
